This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built to deliver a smooth and dynamic user experience entirely within one browser page. Unlike traditional multi-page systems, this application loads content dynamically using JavaScript and framework-based routing, reducing page reloads and improving responsiveness. The SPA structure ensures high performance, modularity, and a modern UI that adapts seamlessly across devices.

Features

 Single Page Navigation: Enables fluid, instant transitions between views without reloading.

 Dynamic Data Handling: Automatically updates data on the screen using state management.

 Responsive UI Design: Works flawlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

 Reusable Components: Modular structure for better maintainability and scalability.

 Local or API Data Storage: Stores data efficiently using browser storage or API calls.

 Routing System: Handles different views (Home, Dashboard, Details, etc.) within one page.

 Optimized Performance: Reduces server load and increases client-side interactivity.

PROJECT REPORT:
Objective:
To design and implement a Task Management SPA that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks in a simple, responsive, and user-friendly environment. The system reduces manual effort in managing tasks, ensures better organization, and encourages productivity through task categorization, priority settings, and status tracking.
System Overview:
The Task Management SPA functions as a dynamic platform where users can manage daily tasks efficiently. we can add new tasks, view task details, update progress, mark tasks as completed, and delete unnecessary tasks. The application ensures smooth navigation, instant updates using frontend state, persistent storage through the browser, and provides a modular design for easy scalability into a full-stack application with backend support.
System Architecture:
[Client Browser] → [React Frontend] → [Local Storage / Future Database] ↓
[Task Module + Status Handling]
↓
[Rendered Task Pages with User Interaction]
Modules Description:
1.	Authentication Module (Future Scope): Provides secure user login and registration for personal task management.
2.	Task Module: Enables users to create, edit, view, and delete tasks with title, description, due date, priority, and category.
3.	Status Module: Allows users to mark tasks as completed or pending, tracking progress effectively.
4.	Filter & Search Module: Enables filtering tasks by category, priority, or status, and searching tasks by title for quick access.
5.	Data Handling Module: Manages storage and retrieval of tasks and their statuses using React state and local Storage (future upgrade: MongoDB/REST API).
Advantages:
•	Simple, user-friendly interface for creating and managing tasks
•	Persistent task and status data using local Storage
•	Lightweight frontend-only design with easy extension to backend
•	Interactive features that enhance productivity and task organization
•	Scalable structure for supporting multiple users and categories
Real-World Use Cases:
•	Personal task management or daily planner app
•	Educational project and assignment tracker
•	Internal team or office task management system
•	Community or group task tracking platform
